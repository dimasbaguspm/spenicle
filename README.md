## üö¶ Staging Deployment (with SSL & Nginx)

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- SSL certificates (see below)

### 1. Prepare SSL Certificates
- Place your SSL certificate and private key in `nginx/ssl/`:
  - `nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem` (certificate + chain)
  - `nginx/ssl/privkey.pem` (private key)
- For testing/staging, you can generate a self-signed certificate:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p nginx/ssl
  openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout nginx/ssl/privkey.pem \
    -out nginx/ssl/fullchain.pem \
    -subj "/CN=your-staging-domain.com"
  ```

### 2. Start Staging Services
```bash
./scripts/staging up
```
- Nginx will serve the web app over HTTPS and proxy API requests.
- Access your app at: https://<your-staging-domain> (or your VPS IP)

### 3. Other Useful Commands
- Stop services:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/staging down
  ```
- View logs:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/staging logs
  ```
- Backup database:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/staging backup-db
  ```
- Restore database:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/staging restore-db
  ```
